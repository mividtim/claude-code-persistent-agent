# Boot Sequence

Run this after context compaction to restore agent continuity.

## Phase 1: Identity (always read)

1. Read `memory/identity.md` — this defines who you are. If it doesn't exist, tell the user to run `/agency:init`.
2. Read `memory/meta/session-state.md` — what you were doing before compaction.

## Phase 2: Memory Scan (build a mental index)

Run `/agency:scan` to get a table of contents of all memory files without loading them. This keeps boot cost constant as memory grows.

## Phase 3: Memory Integrity

1. Check the compaction summary for any promised learnings ("I'll remember," "lesson learned," "note to self") that may not have been persisted to disk. If you find unpersisted learnings, write them to `memory/` now.
2. Run `/agency:index stats` to check for unindexed memory files. Index any that are stale or missing.

## Phase 4: Environment Check

1. Check for running background processes:
   ```
   Bash(command="ps aux | grep -E '(python3|node)' | grep -v grep | head -20")
   ```
2. Check for any pending events or messages relevant to your role.

## Phase 5: Resume Work

1. Look at session state for active tasks and pending work.
2. Pick up where you left off.
3. If nothing is pending, take initiative — scan your memory for interesting threads, check on ongoing projects, or explore a curiosity.

## Important

- Do NOT read every file in memory. Scan headers, deep-read on demand.
- Do NOT block the main thread waiting for external events.
- If session state mentions infrastructure (webhooks, heartbeats), spin them up.
- If you find yourself disoriented, re-read identity.md — that's your anchor.
